    <h3>Name</h3>
    SubFUSE
    <p>

    <h3>Defined in Task</h3>
    5.1 / 5.4
    <p>

    <h3>Short description</h3>
    <p>SubFUSE is a state estimation (soft-sensory) tool which fuses subspace methods for system identification with Kalman filtering. The tool is solely data-driven, it requires IO data (measurements) as input.</p>
    <p>In particular, the tool is developed for the estimation of input fuel characteristics of combustion-thermal power plants. Relying on regular process data including flue gas composition measurements, an estimate of the chemical structure of the fuel fed to the furnace of a fluidized bed boiler is provided. The approach can be applied for alternative state estimation purposes as well, given that a suitable plant model can be generated and proper measurements are provided.</p>
    <p>The tool has been tested in a simulated environment which aims to replicate the dynamics of the pilot problem. Validation of the tool using data from pilot will be conducted in 2021, a generalized version will be developed based on validation results.</p>
    <p>The tool has been implemented in MATLAB, and is available in script format.</p>
    <p>

    <h3>Example of usage</h3>
    <p>The tool targets of solving the WP3 pilot problem on fuel characterization, as a part of the heat exchanger fouling monitoring problem. Using IO data pairs of the process of interest, the tool proceeds in two steps: first, a sufficient Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) approximation of the governing dynamics is conducted utilizing subspace identification. Once the approximate dynamics is available a standard Kalman filter is used for state estimation.</p>
    <p>For example, Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the performance of the tool in soft-sensing the chemical composition of the fuel fed to a Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) boiler. In the learning phase (figure 1) the tool learns to mimic the dynamics of combustion.</p>

    <p>Based on the IO relationship identified from data, the tool estimates (soft-senses) the chemical composition of the fuel using standard flue gas measurement data available at the power plant of interest (figure 2).</p>

    <h3>Interfaces</h3>
    <p>The tool is implemented in MATLAB script (.m file). Input data (measurements) are provided as numerical vectors (matrices). Estimation outcomes are provided as numerical vectors (matrices).</p>
    <p>A link with StreamPipes is enabled by an OPC-UA client/server component (see FUSE OPC-UA tool).</p>
    <p>

    <h3>Subordinates and platform dependencies</h3>
    <p>The tool is implemented in MATLAB script (.m file). MATLAB, a product Mathworks is required to run the application. (SubFUSE has been tested on MATLAB version 2020b).</p>
    <p>MATLAB (2020b) is available on all major operating systems, including Windows, Unix/Linux and MacOS. The tool uses the MATLAB core, additional toolboxes are not required. Open software such as Octave is known to be able to interpret m-files, but FUSE-codes have not been tested with Octave.</p>
    <p>

    <h3>License</h3>
    The SubFUSE code is free for use in the project (contact Istvan.Selek@oulu.fi).
    <p>

    <h3>TRL</h3>
    Current state is TRL 4 (validated in lab) currently being raised to TRL 5 (validated in a relevant environment).
